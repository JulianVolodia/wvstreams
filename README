This branch is special: it contains a series of older branches, each merged
into this one using:

	git merge -s ours --no-ff $BRANCH
	
You can look at which branches we merged by doing this:

	git log --first-parent
	
The purpose is not to actually combine the content of each branch, as you'd
normally do with a merge.  The purpose is just to take the history from all
those extra branches and cram them together into a single name, so that we
don't have to clutter up the branch namespace.

If you ever need to extract the branches back out, you should be able to
determine which one by looking at the commit message (which contains the
branch name) and using the second merge parent (which points at the branch's
complete history).
