.SH DESCRIPTION
UniConf is the One True Configuration system that includes all the
others because it has plugin backends
.I and
frontends. Or, less grandiosely, it's a lightweight, distributed,
cacheable tree of strings.
.PP
.B uni
is used to interface directly with the UniConf system.  It's primary use
is for diagnostic purposes, but it can be used to add UniConf support
to shell scripts.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE"
.TP
.I UNICONF
Before using
.BR uni ,
you must tell it which UniConf moinker you wish to query by setting this
environment variable.  
.PP
Monikers are used to contact UniConf back-ends, be they a
.B uniconfd
server, or a local file.
For example, they could be:
.RS 4
\(bu
a filename
.RI (ini: /var/lib/app/config.ini ),
.br
\(bu
or a network address,
.RI (tcp: open.nit.ca:4111 ).
.RE
.SH COMMANDS
.TP
get
Retreive the
.I VALUE

.I DEFAULT
is provided, this will be returned if the
.I KEY
has no associated
.IR VALUE .
.TP
set
Assign the provided
.I VALUE 
the the provided
.IR KEY .
UniConf provides no guarentee that the entry committed throughout the
database.  The next \(lqget\(rq command for this
.I KEY
may not return the most recently \(lqset\(rq value due to caching, or
the existance of a read-only generator.
.TP
xset
Assign, to the provided
.IR KEY ,
the contents of the standard-input stream.  Use this command to pipe
information into the UniConf database.
.TP
keys
List all the sub-keys contained within the provided
.IR KEY .
.TP
hkeys
List all the sub-keys, recursively, contained within the provided
.IR KEY .
Since any

no circular references.

.IR KEY ,
which can contain wildcards.
