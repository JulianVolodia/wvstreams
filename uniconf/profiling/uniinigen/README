Using valgrind 2.0.0 and valgrind-calltree 0.9.6-2 I've created these 
callgrind outputs you can open with kcachegrind to look at.  Ones labelled
deep were created with nested keys, ones like out.10k are just the keys
and values 1-1000, and ones labelled save involve writing out that many
entries and then saving them.
